  ## Who I Am, Holistically

  👋🏽 Hi there! I'm Brennan Kenneth Brown (my friends call me Kenny), and I'm a lot of things:

  - 🍓 **Founder of Berry House** — Building a more human-centric web through JAMstack development and compelling storytelling

  - ✊🏾 **Indigenous & Queer Voice** — Committed to empowering marginalized communities and centering stories that matter

  - 📚 **Published Author** — Nine books of poetry and essays exploring identity, love, faith, and the human experience

  - 💻 **Open-Source Contributor** — Created 30+ free Jekyll/Eleventy themes and tools used by developers worldwide

  - ♟️ **Competitive Chess Player** — 1900 ELO bullet chess on Lichess (17,918 rated games and counting)

  - 🎓 **English Honours Graduate** — Mount Royal University, 3.8 GPA, founder of Write Club creative writing community

  - 🌐 **Former Hospice Cook, Crisis Support Volunteer, Productivity Analyst** — My diverse background informs everything I create


  I don't fit neatly into boxes, and I'm okay with that. Whether I'm building accessible websites, writing confessional poetry, supporting someone in crisis, or playing speed chess at 2 AM—it's all part of who I am.
