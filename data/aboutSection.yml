  ## Who I Am, Holistically

  👋🏽 Hi there! I'm Brennan Kenneth Brown (my friends call me Kenny), and I'm a lot of things:

  - 🍓 **Founder of [Berry House](https://berryhouse.ca)** — Building a more human-centric web through JAMstack development and compelling storytelling

  - ✊🏾 **Indigenous & Queer Voice** — Committed to empowering marginalized communities and centering stories that matter

  - 📚 **[Published Author](https://www.amazon.ca/stores/author/B0DQTPYKHD)** — Nine books of poetry and essays exploring identity, love, faith, and the human experience

  - 💻 **[Open-Source Contributor](https://github.com/brennanbrown)** — Created 30+ free Jekyll/Eleventy themes and tools used by developers worldwide

  - ♟️ **Competitive Chess Player** — 1900 ELO bullet chess on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/brennankbrown) (17,918 rated games and counting)

  - 🎓 **English Honours Graduate** — Mount Royal University, 3.8 GPA, founder of [Write Club](https://writeclub.ca) creative writing community

  - 🌐 **Former Hospice Cook, Hospital Custodian, and Crisis Support** — My background informs everything I create


  I don't fit neatly into boxes, and I'm okay with that. Whether I'm building accessible websites, writing confessional poetry, supporting someone in crisis, or playing speed chess at 2 AM—it's all part of who I am.
