      I met Brennan at Mount Royal University, and worked alongside him as an executive of The Write Club. Throughout the time that I've known him, Brennan has proven himself to be a driven, caring, highly competent individual. He has consistently demonstrated creativity, problem solving skills, and an aptitude for expansion and growth. Brennan has also fostered an amazing environment for myself and our university peers, constantly striving to help his friends to the best of his ability. I believe Brennan would be an incredible asset to any potential employer.

    comment: Brennan was a fun and instructive member of the InceptionU cohort,
      I feel lucky to have worked with him and gained from his skills as a full stack developer.
      I can without hesitation recommend him for any full stack, front end or back end role.
      Any software company would be fortunate to have him join their team.

      his front end learning project that included JavaScript, React.js and some backend integrations.

      I would like to congratulate Brennan on completing the Front-End curriculum at InceptionU.
      This included JavaScript (Syntax, Logic, Events, DOM, Data Structures, Arrays, Objects/Dictionaries, Linked Lists, State Management, etc.).
      I wish him the best in the technical community.

      I had the pleasure of teaching Brennan in the OnRamp Growth Marketing Bootcamp this year. Brennan is a creative, curious 
      and resourceful problem-solver. During OnRamp, he demonstrated strengths in content development & copywriting (blog, sales sheet),
      campaign design and marketing fundamentals. He always asked really great, thoughtful questions, contributed new ideas and 
      supported his fellow cohort participants when they needed help. Plus his technical coding aptitude gave him a leg-up when 
      tackling the more technical side of marketing tools. He was a pleasure to work with!
