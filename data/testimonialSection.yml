      Heâ€™s extremely knowledgeable and able to apply his expertise with data to any project.

    comment: Brennan was a fun and instructive member of the InceptionU cohort,
      I feel lucky to have worked with him and gained from his skills as a full stack developer.
      I can without hesitation recommend him for any full stack, front end or back end role.
      Any software company would be fortunate to have him join their team.
