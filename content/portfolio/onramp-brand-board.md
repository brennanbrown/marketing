shortDescription: OnRamp is an Alberta-based Growth Marketing Bootcamp that allows learners to work on marketing projects for real, local tech companies. Jumpstarting the careers of young marketers and career pivoters who want to join next-generation tech companies instead of taking some boring old job at a traditional company.
challenge: Figuring out consistency and key visuals for any brand is a challenge. The team will have difficulty staying on the same page when it comes to your brand identity, and there is trouble attracting and retaining customers if they don't have a clear understanding of the brand.
solution: A brand board is an excellent solution for OnRamp because it allows the company to present a consistent image to its customers. It also helps to keep track of the company's branding elements and to make sure that they are being used consistently across all channels and marketing channels, while also specifying the unique target markets.
