shortDescription: I created this website entirely from scratch using Express, Node.js and EJS to showcase my work as a web developer and writer. Featuring my most recent coding projects, blog posts, and how best to contact me if you're interested in collaboration!
challenge: A developer who does not have a portfolio may have difficulty finding work, as many employers prefer to hire developers who can provide examples of their previous work. Without a portfolio, a developer may also have difficulty demonstrating their skills and abilities to potential employers.
solution: By creating this portfolio, I am able showcase my skills and experience, making myself more attractive to potential employers or clients. A portfolio can also help developers to keep track of their past work and see their progress over time. Additionally, a portfolio can serve as a platform for developers to share their ideas and connect with other like-minded individuals.
