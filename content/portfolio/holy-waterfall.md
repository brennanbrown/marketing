shortDescription: Tucked away from the monotone hustle of the world, Holy Waterfall brings readers on a journey through the personal and profound trails of my poetic exploration. This debut chapbook features a series of confessional poetry and outsider art, delving into themes of Indigenous identity, religious beliefs, traumatic past, family, love, and more.
challenge: Aspiring poets and literary enthusiasts often struggle to find a platform to share their deeply personal and profound works. There is a need for poetry that authentically explores complex identities and experiences, providing a space for healing and affirmation.
solution: Holy Waterfall is my reflection of the soul, a way to cleanse and renew the spirit. Through a collection of poetic stories, musings, and confessional moments, I invite readers to traverse my perspectives on the world. This chapbook offers a space for healing, celebration of identity, and exploration of life's difficult and joyous moments.
