shortDescription: Several different themes I've created for the JAMstack Jekyll generator from scratch, focusing on performance and accessibility while still maintaining good design principles, and free to use!
challenge: Although there are many tools and methods of creating a blog, I found myself never fully sastified with any of the available options. There is not enough emphasis on user-accessibility, speed, and overall aesthetics.
solution: Due to these unique challenges, I decided to embark on learning how to create fully-featured blog templates in the static site generator Jekyll with specific purposes.

- 🚰 [**Watery**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/watery): A minimalist, bare-bones theme for Jekyll only using the Water.css framework while still following the best practices for accessibility and search-engine optimization.
- 📓 [**Purelog**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/purelog): A responsive sidebar Jekyll theme using the Pure.css framework, designed for writers and bloggers of all kinds.
