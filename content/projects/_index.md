# Other Projects

Beyond blog themes, I've developed a variety of web applications, developer tools, and community websites. These projects showcase my full-stack development skills, from Flask and Django backends to React frontends.

Many of these projects serve real communities and users, while others are developer tools designed to make workflows more efficient.
