# JAMstack and Blog Themes

I've created and maintain a collection of open-source blog themes for Hugo, Astro.js, Jekyll and Eleventy (11ty) static site generators. These themes are designed to be accessible, customizable, and easy to deploy.

All themes are available on GitHub with MIT licenses, making them free to use, modify, and distribute. They're actively maintained and used by developers around the world.
