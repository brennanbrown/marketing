## About

Hi there! I'm Brennan, but my friends call me Kenny. I'm the founder and current president of Write Club—a Queer-led and Indigenous-led creative collective based out of Calgary, Alberta that's focused on fostering a community of writers, helping emerging young adults find their truth and voice through the power of storytelling.

I've had the privilege of nurturing a vibrant learning community, focusing on enhancing creative writing skills and promoting intellectual diversity. My work extends to raising funds for causes like the Canadian Children's Literacy Foundation and Ripple Foundation, and spearheading projects that bring literature closer to people's hearts.

I'm currently navigating the final chapters of my English Honours degree at Mount Royal University, where I've immersed myself in advanced studies of poetry, scriptwriting, and creative nonfiction, maintaining a 3.94 GPA and contributing to the literary community through various platforms.

In the past, I've been a growth marketer and open-source web developer. I'm looking to do good—and I mean real good. Whether it's through developing engaging workshops, curating digital publications, or leading people-focused initiatives, I want to empower marginalized voices, emphasize stories that matter, and create long-lasting community. I'm looking to help those in the Alberta area with their next project with the unique skill-set I have!

I also love developing lean marketing campaigns with assets including content strategy, copywriting, growing organic search presence, as well as staying measured and organized in a variety of CRMs such as HubSpot, Monday.com, and Notion. I'm knowledgeable in multiple front-end frameworks and ecosystems, as well as an advocate for accessibility and the A11y project in web development.

## Recommendations

### Felix Da Costa Gomez
*English Honours Graduate | Mount Royal University Alumni | Aspiring Writer*

"Strong, community orientated leader who I have had the pleasure of working with. Acting as the Founding President of Mount Royal University's Creative Writing Club, Kenneth has fostered a strong community where individuals invested in professional and emotional relationships. His ability as a leader has enabled others to grow, and his conscientiousness is an asset in making hard decisions. In terms of specific skills, being an English Honours student alongside Kenneth affirms that he is skillful in editing, proofreading, critical analysis, and he has a keen attention to detail that makes him reliable in any project format. Kenneth's knack for managing websites also proves that he has skills outside of his degree and he is a proficient article writer on Medium, striking cold facts and personal truth that adds to the depth of his writing ability. Thoughtful, sharp, and adaptable."

### Benjamin Urquhart

"I met Kenneth at Mount Royal University, and worked alongside him as an executive of The Write Club. Throughout the time that I've known him, Kenneth has proven himself to be a driven, caring, highly competent individual. He has consistently demonstrated creativity, problem solving skills, and an aptitude for expansion and growth. Kenneth has also fostered an amazing environment for myself and our university peers, constantly striving to help his friends to the best of his ability. I believe Kenneth would be an incredible asset to any potential employer."
