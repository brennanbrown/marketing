* As you can see, I put many helpful documents in the `docs` folder to help you with the following updates, modifications, and additions. Please look through all of them before we begin.
* Replace the hero image:
* First, more than anything, I want to have more focus on my new initiative, "🍓 Berry House". Please read through the doc berryhouse.md for more info on this.
  * I want a red section of the site that follows the theming of the rest of the site.
  * Show that if you want to work with me, the best option for someone is to get in touch with Berry House rather than hiring me directly (although still have the option for people to hire me if they _really_ want to, or just contact me for other things, more on this later)
* Regarding design overall, while I enjoy "blue" being the main colour branding of the website, I think it would be fun if every section had a subtle shift so the entire website was more ROYGBIV starting with the new Berry House section.

* This is important: Overall, I want to realign the purpose of the website to be more about people being able to support me if they appreciate the FOSS work I've been doing for free, with a new CTA section that links to both my ko-fi (https://ko-fi.com/brennan) and my GitHub sponsors page.
  * Also make a new page for "tiers" in regards to perks people could get if they donate to me monthly. Base this around my skillset and experience, and have it be realistic.
  * I want people to see me more holistically overall when they visit the site; right now, it is rather corporate and only focuses on particular dimensions of me. I hope the revamp will change that! Tweak some of the copy throughout the main page to reflect this as well, please.

* Have a "books" section that acts similar to the portfolio section, have about ~3 books on the home page and then give people a link to a dedicated book page for more info, the info of all the books is in books.md
  * Have the cover, links to Amazon and Gumroad, and brief excerpts on the homepage, and all the same on the books page except have much longer descriptions of each book there.

* I want to overhaul the portfolio section as well. I want there to be a dedicated section just for the blog themes I've made (eg. )
  * Then, have another section on the main page for my other projects outside of my themes
  * Use the screenshots in the screenshot folder for this. Similar to the books section, have 3 or 4 on the main page then a dedicated page people can click-through for more information

* Regarding updating my info: Put that I was the President of Write Club up until June 2025 and put my current position just as founder. I also graduated in April 2025 with a 3.8 GPA.
  * Put information about Berry House, and label me as both Founder and Lead Developer
  * Add my Journal.kim/journalbar experience and a link to the site
  * Add a new subsection detailing my previous work history, like at the hospice, ServiceMaster, 7cups, demonstrating me more holistically, found in the doc previous-work.md

* Add a CTA in the writing section for people to check out my writing in a few other places:
  * my Medium blog https://blog.brennanbrown.ca
  * my poetry on tumblr https://bkpoetry.com
  * my microessays on Bluesky, Threads, and Matsodon

* Add a "hobbies" section that highlights less career-oriented things I do but rather just the interesting other things I do, use much smaller images and ensure this section doesn't take up as much space and is near the end, more info in hobbies.md:
  * Add a "chess" subsection highlighting my extensive playing and linking to my lichess for anybody that wants to play with me. Particularly highlight how I hit 1900 ELO last summer in bullet chess. More info in chess.md
  * Add a subsection to my previous creative projects I worked on when I was much younger (use much smaller images)
