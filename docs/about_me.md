## About Me :wave:

Hey there! :smile: My name is Brennan, I'm a 29-year-old Queer Métis JAMstack developer and content strategist from Winnipeg, Manitoba and currently reside in Calgary, Alberta. In April 2025, I graduated from Mount Royal University with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in English Honours, and have also completed both the Full-Stack Developer Program at [InceptionU](https://www.inceptionu.com/full-stack-developer-program) in 2020 and the Growth Marketing Bootcamp at [OnRamp](https://www.linkedin.com/school/joinonramp/) in 2022, and I'm looking to help those that need web development work done, or searching for ideas and management for their next content project.

I would also love to volunteer my time to contributing to open-source projects! I love creating and tinkering with small, static websites and projects. I'm a big proponent of putting an emphasis on accessibility and the [A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) in web development.

I'm always looking to work with people that are hopeless idealists like me, as well as who are interested in creating and working on cool, interesting, and meaningful projects! Shoot me [**an e-mail**](mailto:mail@brennanbrown.ca) if that sounds like your cup of tea.
