## About

👋🏽 Hi there! I'm Brennan, but my friends call me Kenny. I'm a Queer Métis web developer, content strategist, and the founder of Berry House, a small, values-driven studio building fast, accessible JAMstack websites and thoughtful content for the independent Internet.

Berry House operates on a dual mission: providing professional services to corporate clients and small teams while offering pro bono and pay-what-you-can support to marginalized communities, vulnerable individuals, and low-income nonprofits. Every paid project helps me continue providing accessible web services to those who need them most.

I recently graduated with my BA in English (Honours) from Mount Royal University (3.8 GPA), where I focused on rhetoric, narrative craft, and how literary studies can transform digital practices. I blend editorial expertise with lean engineering—favoring Eleventy, progressive enhancement, and accessibility-first interfaces.

Beyond Berry House, I'm the founder of Write Club (https://writeclub.ca) which is a creative collective for based in Calgary that fosters a community of writers and helps emerging young adults find their truth and voice through storytelling. Over three years, we've raised funds for the Canadian Children's Literacy Foundation and Ripple Foundation, and created spaces where marginalized voices are centered and amplified.

My work threads through:
→ JAMstack development (Eleventy, Hugo, Astro)
→ Content strategy & copywriting
→ Growth marketing (OnRamp training)
→ Full-stack development (SAIT, InceptionU)
→ Community building & workshop facilitation
→ Open-source contributions (11ty IndieWeb Blog Starter, Purelog, Enjoyment Work)

I'm an advocate for digital autonomy, accessibility (A11y Project), and the IndieWeb. I believe in calm technology people can own, privacy-respecting analytics, and portable content that outlasts any platform. I'm passionate about helping Alberta-based organizations—especially nonprofits and community groups—build sustainable web presences.

If you think I can help with your next project, or you just wanna chat over a cup of decaf coffee, reach out: hi@berryhouse.ca
