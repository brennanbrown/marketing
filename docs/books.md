For the past ten years, debut author and lifelong poet Brennan Kenneth Brown has carefully and, in secret, been crafting THE DOGWOOD VERSES. This anthology of poetry has over 300 different individual works, including selected prose and essays, and is comprised of four smaller books written over the past decade: The Juvenila (2011 — 2013), The Hyacinth Boy (2014 — 2017), The Pine Chapter (2018 — 2020), and The Last Call (2020 — 2021). An inevitable cocktail of nostalgia, regret and love—those long, difficult nights when sentimentality took over any common sense. It is a slow-burn meditation on everything vital, everything that's keeping the author alive.

This debut chapbook is a series of confessional poetry and outsider art, the culmination of the poet's ten years of effort to explore his Indigenous identity, religious beliefs, traumatic past, family, love, and all of the uncomfortable and undiscovered feelings in between. Brown faithfully directs our journey by representing his heroic battle with the psychological intertwining of his ancestry and his own universal experiences—all of which form his unique identity as a young Queer Métis poet. A Gospel of poetry and art, Holy Waterfall works as a reflection of the poet's soul, a way to cleanse and renew the spirit.

An collection of thirty-seven love poems centered around a transcendental love for his partner Connie.

Brown's spare yet resonant verses chart the topography of devotion—moments of joy, desire, doubt, comfort, and more. These love letters are steeped in symbolism, weaving themes of fate, gravity, and more. The Weight of Yr Heart is a melodic, bittersweet ode made all the more poignant for its ephemerality—love as butterfly wings, gossamer yet heavy with meaning.

A daring anthology written by Mount Royal University's Write Club—a foray into difficult and untamed territories of human experience. Through murky waters of controversy, On the Fringe explores the very boundaries that most fear to tread—sex, death, crime. Both shocking and profound, this anthology questions the norms, rejects the banal, and offers a rare glimpse into what lies beneath the surface of decorum. From musings on chronic illness to vivid depictions of Queer joy, from the grim realities of suffering to riotous celebrations of the political fringe.

### 6. Your Brothers Keeper: A Love Letter to Dostoevsky
**Publication Date:** August 3, 2024  
**Format:** Paperback  
**Pages:** 40  
**ISBN-13:** 979-8334888722  
**Dimensions:** 12.7 x 0.25 x 20.32 cm  

What does a 19th-century Russian novel have to do with today? In "Your Brothers Keeper," a young poet finds an unlikely kindred spirit in Fyodor Dostoevsky. The collection of poems in this chapbook are part love letter, part wrestling match with one of the greatest novels of all time, The Brothers Karamazov. From the sterile halls of a children's hospice to the snowy streets of St. Petersburg, these poems grapple with faith, doubt, and the messiness of being human. You'll find Queer retellings of Dostoevsky's characters, decolonial perspectives on Russian literature, and quiet moments of grace amidst suffering.

### 7. The Reaper and Her Sickle: Rough Cuts, Spares, Afterthoughts, B-Sides and Experiments
**Publication Date:** August 11, 2024  
**Format:** Paperback  
**Pages:** 252  
**ISBN-13:** 979-8387237157  
**Dimensions:** 12.7 x 1.6 x 20.32 cm  

A raw, unfiltered glimpse into the creative process of emerging poet Brennan Kenneth Brown. This 250-page compendium collects three years of unpublished writings, discarded drafts, and experimental verses from Brown's undergraduate journey at Mount Royal University. Unlike Brown's previous works, this collection lacks a cohesive theme. Instead, it offers a difficult view of a poet finding his voice. Brown preserves these pieces in their original, unedited form—awkward rhythms, half-formed metaphors, unfinished characters and all. A meditation on the act of writing itself, on first drafts and beautiful failures.

### 8. PRAIRIE BOYSPIRIT: An NDN Memoir
**Publication Date:** December 11, 2024  
**Format:** Paperback  
**Pages:** 50  
**ISBN-13:** 979-8303372290  
**Dimensions:** 12.7 x 0.33 x 20.32 cm  
**Rating:** 5.0/5 stars (1 rating)

A Queer Métis writer bleeds truth onto the page, confronting addiction, white-passingness, and cultural displacement while burning sage from crystal shops and praying to a God that's equal parts Catholic guilt and Cree cosmology. In this debut collection of linked essays, Brown maps the invisible territories where Indigenous and settler identities collide and coalesce, where ceremony bleeds into survival, and where the wild refuses to be forgotten. Through bizarre-lyric prose cutting as deep as prairie frost, Brown chronicles his journey as a Queer Métis man navigating urban landscapes and ancestral memories.
